# Fjord, F&#35; programming language for the JVM.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jkone27/fjord/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jkone27/fjord/actions)

Fjord is an implementation of the [F#][F#] programming language for the JVM.

*The implementation is at very early stages, so if you are looking to use F# on
the JVM, Fjord is probably not for you.* However, if you are interested in
hacking on F# implementation for the JVM, welcome on board!

## Building Fjord

### Requirements

Fjord is built and packaged with [Apache Maven][Apache Maven] and requires Java
1.8 or higher to build and run.

### Building from sources

To build F#, run:

```
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1g"
mvn package
```

### Trying it out

To launch the F# interactive shell run:

```
./bin/fji
```

and you are greeted with:

```
Fjord

For help type #help
> _
```

You can then evaluate F# expressions:

```
> let x = 1 + 2
val x = 3
```

## Features

* Aims at F# 3.0 language compatibility
